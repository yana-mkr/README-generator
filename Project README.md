In this project, I used node.js to create a program that generates a README.md file for any project. 
This README.md file includes a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions for the project. It also includes the users GitHub url and a mailto link for contact. 
The README.md includes functioning table of contents and license badges as well.
